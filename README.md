# Easy money service
What is it?
“Easy Money” is a fully adaptive front-end side of a simple freelance platform where customer can place an order and freelancer can take the order and perform it.
How to use it?
In the CUSTOM tab, user can leave his order by filling out a fully valid form.
After that, the order will be displayed in the FREELANCER tab in the form of a table of orders with its primary information and with a deadline that shows how much time is left in days or hours (if there are less than two days left).
If you click on an order, a modal window appears with detailed information on the order, where you can contact the customer and accept the order. After the order has been accepted, it becomes green in the order table.
If you click on the accepted order, a modal window appears with information on the order and the ability to complete the order or to refuse it. If the order was completed, then it disappears from the list of orders.
